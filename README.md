# IMDb Sentiment Analysis

Solution for first assessment from [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).

The objective of this project is to develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The resulting machine model was deployed with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

In this repo, you"ll find:

- images: screenshots from the web app with examples of inference using the deployed model
- serve: python files used to deploy the RNN model with SageMaker
- train: python files used to train the RNN model with SageMaker
- website: html file with user interface for submitting movie reviews for inference
- report.pdf: final notebook with the process to build the RNN model
- SageMaker Project.ipynb: notebook with all the process from preparing and processing data to SageMaker deployment
